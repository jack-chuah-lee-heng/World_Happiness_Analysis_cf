# Project Brief: World Happiness Analysis Project

## Executive Summary

This dataset can help us understand which countries are the happiest in the world and why. Identifying the factors that contribute to happiness can help us create a blueprint for a happier future.
The world happiness dataset is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating the International Day of Happiness on March 20th. 
As described in data source, this study continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. The study reviews the state of happiness today and shows how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations.
The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia. This hypothetical country has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They do not impact the total score reported for each country, but they explain why some countries rank higher than others.


## Key Questions and Objectives

1.	What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness?
2.	Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness for the past 5 years (from 2015 to 2019)?
3.	What factors that contribute to happiness? What can we learn from these countries? 


## Limitation and Ethics
1.	Data set available are from 2015 to 2019, which makes it difficult to accurately predict the current happiness trends year especially during the Covid19 and after Covid19.
2.	The scores are from nationally representative samples. It could be resulting in sample bias. If there is a lack of diversity within that sample, it could be biased. 
3.	The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. It could be also the measurement bias occurred when there is a problem with the humans doing the measuring.

## Conclusion & Recommendation

Most Happiest Countries came from Scandinava - Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. 

Australia and New Zealand both sat at the happiest countries since 2015. 

The happiness countries count in America Region dropped after year 2019. 

Asia’s happiness score was sitting at lower happiness range and the countries count in lower happiness raised in 2019. 

Economy GDP, Health Life Expectancy and Social Support are the main factors contribute to the happiest environment. A higher standard of living and health
life expectancy, which normally leads to happier people. This is evident when looking at the world’s happiest countries. These countries tend to have strong 
social support systems, which also contribute to the happiness of its citizen.This is because social support provides a sense of security and belonging, both
are essential for happiness. 

Freedom, Trust, Generosity, Dystopia Residual have weak relationship with the happiness score.  

To collect more data set from 2020 to 2022, to have a better understanding to the current happiness score especially to capture the happiness score during the Covid-19 and after the Covid-19

The data set could be sample bias. Suggest to collect the data set in a wider population.
